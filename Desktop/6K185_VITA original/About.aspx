     Each year, the Tippie College of Business Beta Alpha Psi chapter offers our 
    Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, helping low and moderate income 
    taxpayers in the Johnson County area prepare and file their taxes. We are part 
    of the Johnson County Earned Income Tax Outreach Campaign, a project devoted to 
    supporting the financial security of working families in Johnson County by 
    offering free tax preparation services.
    <br />
    <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        From January 30, 2013, through April, 14, 2013, our volunteers will staff four 
        locations in the Johnson County area, providing free tax help, preparation, and 
        filing. We offer electronic filing, so that taxpayers can receive their tax 
        refunds quickly. Taxpayers using VITA volunteers to help file their taxes, do 
        not pay to have their returns prepared, and they do not pay to get their 
        refunds.
        <br />
            <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        All our volunteers are accounting majors at the University of Iowa Tippie 
        College of Business or law students at the University of Iowa College of Law. 
        Our volunteers are certified by the IRS in preparing returns and have had at 
        least one tax course as part of their Tippie College coursework or as part of 
        their law training.
